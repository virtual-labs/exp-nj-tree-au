### About the Experiment 

The Neighbor-Joining (NJ) algorithm is a popular method used to create phylogenetic trees, which show the evolutionary relationships between species. In this experiment, the NJ algorithm is implemented to build a tree based on a distance matrix. This helps in understanding how species are related and how they have evolved over time.
